        "Description": "Running out of options and money, single mum Callie sets foot in the small town of Summerville, Oklahoma, with her two teenage children, Phoebe and Trevor. And now, there is no turning back. As the family attempts to settle in the dilapidated house of Callie's eccentric late father, unexpected secrets hidden in plain sight, mysterious equipment, and a strange vehicle rotting in the barn seem to relate to the area's puzzling seismic activity, and something even more shocking: the long-forgotten Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man Incident in 1980s New York City. But there hasn't been a single ghost sighting since the bizarre events of Ghostbusters II (1989). Is history repeating itself? Will Phoebe connect the dots, give her grandfather a voice, and discover the family's connection to the original Ghostbusters (1984)?",
